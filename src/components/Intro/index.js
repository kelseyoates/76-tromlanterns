      <p>
      Political risk used to be simple. There were just a few world powers and things moved slowly. We could make accurate assessments with fewer tools and less time.
      </p>
      <p>
      Fast-forward to the Arab Spring, Brexit, trade wars - the world is more diverse, more complicated, and the biggest events seem to come out of nowhere. So if the world has changed, shouldnâ€™t our analysis change with it?
      </p>


      <p>We formed Two Lanterns to address this chasm - a more complicated world needed a deeper and more robust way of analyzing and forecasting political risk. We use our expertise and experience to deliver political risk analysis in a new and more accurate way. We draw from behavioral economics, international relations, intelligence studies, and continuous research in the practice of political risk.</p>
